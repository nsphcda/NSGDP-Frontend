  },
  {
    id: "faq-account",
    group: "Getting started",
    question: "I didn't get my invite email. What now?",
    answer:
      "Check spam first. Then ask your Development Partner Admin to resend the invite from Dev Partner → Invites. If you are the first person at your organisation, contact the data team.",
  },
  {
    id: "faq-role",
    group: "Getting started",
    question: "What is the difference between a contributor and an admin?",
    answer:
      "Contributors upload and track datasets, documents, and programme reports. Admins do all of that plus invite and manage members, approve access requests, and edit the partner profile.",
  },
  {
    id: "faq-formats",
    group: "Uploading",
    question: "Which file formats can I upload?",
    answer:
      "CSV, Excel, JSON, GeoJSON, GeoPackage, and KML. PDFs and other documents go through Documents. You can attach several files to one dataset.",
  },
  {
    id: "faq-draft-file",
    group: "Uploading",
    question: "Can I save a draft without a file?",
    answer:
      "No. A file is required even for drafts so reviewers have something to check when you submit. Attach a placeholder file if you need to hold the record.",
  },
  {
    id: "faq-dhis2",
    group: "Uploading",
    question: "How do I share DHIS2 data?",
    answer:
      "Export from DHIS2 as CSV or Excel and upload it like any dataset. Tag it dhis2, mention DHIS2 in Methodology, and set the update frequency. Automatic sync is not available yet.",

    group: "Uploading",
    question: "What if I leave the wizard halfway?",
    answer:
      "You will be warned before leaving a filled-in form. Save as draft on the last step to keep your work; drafts appear under Datasets.",

  {
    id: "faq-time",
    group: "Review & publishing",
    question: "How long does review take?",
    answer:
      "It depends on queue size and dataset complexity. You are notified at each stage, so there is no need to keep checking. Complete metadata and tidy files are the biggest speed-ups.",
  },
  {
    id: "faq-approved",
    group: "Review & publishing",
    question: "My dataset is Approved but not in the catalogue. Why?",
    answer:
      "Approval is final sign-off; publishing is a separate action by a publisher. Once published it appears in the catalogue according to its visibility.",
  },
  {
    id: "faq-edit",
    group: "Review & publishing",
    question: "Can I edit a dataset while it's under review?",
    answer:
      "Not while it is being reviewed. If reviewers request revisions it returns to you for editing.",
  },
  {
    id: "faq-versions",
    group: "Review & publishing",
    question: "How do I update a dataset for a new period?",
    answer:
      "Add the new file to the existing dataset instead of creating a new one. Each upload becomes a version and goes back through review.",

  {
    id: "faq-visibility",

    id: "faq-pii",
    group: "Access & privacy",
    question: "Can I upload patient-level data?",

      "No. Aggregate or de-identify data before upload. Datasets containing identifiable personal health information will be returned or rejected.",
  },
  {
    id: "faq-withdraw",
    group: "Access & privacy",
    question: "Can I take my data down later?",
    answer:
      "Yes — use Retract on the dataset page. Drafts and pending datasets are archived immediately; reviewed or published ones need super admin approval. NSPHCDA may keep a copy where the law or audit requires it.",
  },
  {
    id: "faq-preview",
    group: "Analytics & maps",
    question: "Why does the preview show only some rows?",

      "Previews are a limited sample to help you judge a dataset. Download it for the full data.",
  },
  {
    id: "faq-analytics-missing",
    group: "Analytics & maps",
    question: "My dataset is published but not in analytics. Why?",
    answer:
      "Analytics uses data that has been loaded into the analytics warehouse. That happens after publication and can wait on resolving indicator names. Ask the data team if it has been several days.",
  },
  {
    id: "faq-ward-empty",
    group: "Analytics & maps",
    question: "Why is the ward chart empty?",
    answer:
      "Many indicators are reported only at LGA level. An empty ward chart usually means no ward breakdown exists, not that data is missing.",
